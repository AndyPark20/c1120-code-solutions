        <div class="column-roi">
          <h2>1. <span>Making the Decision To Switch</span></h2>
          <p>You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that
            we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on investment. Our goal
            is to give you as much informaiton as possible to make this determination one way
            or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for
            you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current customers to talk about their
            experience.
          </p>

        <div class="column-roi">
          <h2>2. <span>Interfaces and Community Integration</span></h2>
          <p>Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community resources.
            At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling your payers with our clearinghouse, and
            getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into
            Canvas so that
            sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health information exchanges or
            other information technology
            vendors are important, we will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.
          </p>

        <div class="column-roi">
          <h2>3. <span>Data Migration</span></h2>
          <p>The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which we have executed
            successfully with
            both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our work begins to impport into Canvas. Patient
            demographics and information like medications,
            problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward. While importing clinical notes and couments is more
            challenging, our team has been able to
            do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.

        <div class="column-roi">
          <h2>4. <span>Training and Site Visit</span></h2>
          <p>We will work iwth you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content, charge schedules, and much
            more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks
            prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team memebrs with clinnical, practice management, and billing
            workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our team
            can visit your practicce to work side-by-side with you on implementation and training.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column-roi">
          <h2>5. <span>Go-Live and Tuning</span></h2>
          <p>Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your pracice. We wil be with you,
            either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure everything goes smoothly. There is always fine
            tuning to do once you have a handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates, setting up new automations,
            modifying pracice mangement settings, and more. We are here to help with it all.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column-roi">
          <h2>6. <span>Sustained Performance</span></h2>
          <p>All EMR contracts should contain assurances aginast broken promises and provide support over the long term.
            Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all paymentns
            back. (We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a MIPS guarantee: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it.
            And for everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a long, productive partnership for us both.
