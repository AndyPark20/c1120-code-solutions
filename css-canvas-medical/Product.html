          <h2>It's the foundation for patient-centered primary care.</h2>
          <p>Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across clinicians,
            staff, and patients themselves- making you more productive, less stressed, and
            adding just a bit more joy into your practice of medicine.

              pulls everything you need directly into your note, so you never have to leave it.
              And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.

              protocls and charge
